								<h2>Statement about needs</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The range of physical disability catered for is very wide, as is the range of learning difficulty.  The majority of pupils have one or more additional disabilities associated with their physical conditions.  These include:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>learning difficulties mild to severe</li>
								<li>hearing impairment</li>
								<li>visual impairment</li>
								<li>perceptual problems</li>
								<li>communication difficulties due to limitations of speech musculature</li>
								<li>complex medical condition</li>
							</ul>
							<p>At Saxon Wood we recognise that the diversity of pupil need requires a curriculum which is complex enough to meet these needs and improve pupil outcomes.</p>
							<p>For further information please see our <a href="docs/2020/saxon-wood-school-curriculum-feb-2020.pdf">Saxon Wood Curriculum Statement</a></p>

								<h2>Early Years Foundation Stage</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The early years at Saxon Wood includes children in both Willow Class (Nursery) and Oak Class (Year R). This Policy covers the curriculum for pupils two years old until the end of Year R and incorporates the curriculum guidance for the foundation stage.</p>
							<p>The curriculum is divided into 7 areas of learning and development. Children should mostly develop the 3 prime areas first. These are:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>Communication and language</li>
								<li>Physical development</li>
								<li>Personal, social and emotional development</li>
							</ul>
							<p>As children grow, the prime areas will help them to develop skills in 4 specific areas. These are:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>Literacy</li>
								<li>Mathematics</li>
								<li>Understanding the world</li>
								<li>Expressive arts and design</li>
							</ul>
							<p>These 7 areas are used to plan your child’s learning and activities.  Staff will make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs.  This is a bit like a curriculum in primary and secondary schools, but it is suitable for very young children. It is designed to be really flexible so that staff can follow your child’s unique needs and interests.  Children in the EYFS learn by playing and exploring, being active, and through creative and critical thinking which takes place both indoors and outside.</p>

								<h2>Sensory Curriculum</h2>
							</header>
							<p><b>Our sensory curriculum is in the developmental stages. Planning and resources are evolving to provide an increasingly rich and balanced curriculum.</b></p><p>

								Saxon Wood prides itself on our provision for children with multisensory and complex medical needs. Staff in the sensory class are experienced in working alongside children with a range of sensory needs including, but not limited to, visual, auditory and multisensory impairment as well as those with PMLD. Both Oak and Willow (nursery) teachers have qualifications from SENSE and NATSIP respectively and have cascaded this training to their class teams where appropriate. </p><p>
								
								All staff in this class are experienced in utilising multichannel communication strategies such as Objects of Reference, Eyegaze, hand-on-body signing, Makaton and symbolic communication in order to best facilitate children in accessing and understanding the world around them. </p><p>
								
								Physiotherapy and positioning happens across the day in class and programmes are devised according to children's individual needs. The wide range of sensory resources, including the option to black out Oak Class and turn it into its own sensory room, serves as the perfect motivator to make therapy sessions enjoyable and engaging. </p><p>
								
								Our Acheeva bed learning stations and positioning equipment also allows for children with highly complex medical needs to continue to engage in activities while positioned at an optimal level of safety and comfort. </p><p>
								
								Class staff work closely with our onsite Associate Medical Practitioner and between us we are able to competently deal with a wide range of medical needs. It is a priority for us that all children feel safe, comfortable and happy.

								<h2>Multidisciplinary</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Staff have examined a range of approaches and studied relevant research, and our practice is under continual review.  We believe that we are using the most effective and appropriate methods for our pupils.  Saxon Wood aims to be a school with a therapeutic environment.  In practice this means that during a pupil's day, he or she may be undertaking a therapeutic programme whilst simultaneously working at curricular activities such as literacy or mathematics.  Wherever possible they are undertaking therapeutic activities in a functional and meaningful way.</p>
							<p>All pupils for whom it is appropriate will have a Physical Management Programme.  This is an outline of how each pupil's needs are going to be met, through postural management, mobility activities and independence skills practice.  All staff are trained how to facilitate pupils' movements, and are aware of the current physical and functional independence goals for each of their pupils.  These goals are discussed and reviewed termly at interdisciplinary class discussion.  We believe that this combined approach is most likely to enable each pupil to achieve his or her potential in terms of independent function.</p>

						<section id="communicationskills">
							<header>
								<h2>Development of Communication Skills</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The school has developed particular expertise with respect to teaching communication skills to non-vocal pupils.  These pupils will be using Alternative or Augmented Communication Aids, including signs, symbol systems and voice output devices.  Staff aim to ensure that all pupils have as many opportunities for real communication as possible.</p>
						</section>
						<section id="reading">
							<header>
								<h2>Reading at Saxon Wood</h2>
							</header>
							<p>At Saxon Wood we use a combination of mainstream and SEN approaches to meet the needs of our children.  We recognise that reading for the pupils at Saxon Wood encompasses more than an ability to read the written text.  
							Many of our children are at a pre reading stage of development and a large majority are either non verbal or have limited speech.
							To meet these needs we use a wide range of strategies in addition to exposure to reading across the curriculum.  These include symbol timetables, symbol based communication devices, objects of reference, tactile timetables, and PECS.  For pre reading children, children with severe visual or hearing impairments we use a range of sensory materials.   All of these strategies are used to enable children to decode and understand the world around them.</p>
							<p>In addition:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>We use the Oxford Reading Tree scheme and have a large selection of fiction, nonfiction and poetry to match each of the stages.</li>
								<li>Enlarged Oxford Reading Tree books are available for children with visual impairment.</li>
								<li>In school we access The Oxford Owl website which has a selection of online audio books and activities. Children are encouraged to use this at home. Click the image below to visit the Oxford Owl website: <br><a href="http://www.oxfordowl.co.uk"><img border="0" alt="Oxford Owl" src="images/primary_oxfordowl_logo_school_web.gif" height="150px" width="120px"></a></li>
								<li>We use Espresso which supports literacy skills. Children can access this at home with their own login.</li>
								<li>Taped stories and CDs are available for children with visual impairments to listen to stories independently.</li>
								<li>The Hampshire Library Service provides us with additional books and materials on a termly basis to support our areas of study and to meet pupils' interests.</li>
								<li>Phonics is taught across the school using a combination of Jolly Phonics and Letters and Sounds.</li>
								<li>ICT such as iPads or tablets are used to encourage reading as well as ICT skills.</li>
								<li>Displays and worksheets and class based resources are often produced using symbols to increase children’s access to written material.</li>
								<li>Each year we celebrate Book Week and children have an opportunity to get involved in all sorts of fun activities related to reading.</li>
								<li>Our school library area is updated on a regular basis</li>
							</ul>
							<p>IEP targets along with reading records are used to measure progress and identify areas in need of improvement/development.
							The Speech and Language therapy and communication programmes also reinforce language acquisition and functional reading.</p>

								<h2>Physical Management Programmes</h2>
							</header>
							<p>An integrated therapy/physical management programme for each pupil is offered as part of their Individual Education Plan.  Education staff and Health Authority staff work very closely with each other and with parents, to ensure that pupils' needs are met in a planned and co-ordinated way.  The school has developed a transdisciplinary approach to meeting pupils' movement and therapy needs.  Members of the interdisciplinary team based at Saxon Wood share their expertise and knowledge stimulating professional development across traditional professional boundaries.</p>

								<h2>Pupil Premium</h2>
							</header>
							<p>From September 2012, schools have a statutory obligation to publish details of their Pupil Premium allocation, use and impact. Schools, head teachers and teachers will decide how to use the Pupil Premium allocation, as they are best placed to assess what additional provision should be made for individual pupils. Source DfE website. Further, OFSTED will 'pay particular attention to how schools are using the pupil premium to improve pupils' achievement'. Listed below is a detailed breakdown of how the school has used the funding for those who are eligible to receive the Pupil Premium. 
							</p>
							<p><strong>Pupil premium 2018/2019</strong></p>
							<p>We received £15,550 for pupil premium. This has been used to provide sensory OT sessions for two pupils and to provide extra staff support for our children who require additional support due to their complex needs, which create barriers to their learning. </p><p>
								During the Autumn Term whole school IEP analysis for communication showed 79% of children achieving their targets with pupil premium children achieving 80%. For literacy 80% and 82% respectively and for PSD 84% and 80%. </p><p>
								With regard to P level data the trend for 2017/2018 was that the pupil premium children achieved 86% of their targets for Literacy, and maths. 100% achieved expectations for PSD (Personal and Social Development). </p><p>
								The 2018/20 pupil premium will be £11,460 and we intend to use funding for additional classroom support.
								</p>

						<section id="sportsfunding">

								<h2>Sports Funding</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							<b>2018/2019</b> We received £12,862 in sports funding.  Over the year we had a focus on the integration of therapy into PE sessions and across the school curriculum. As a result, over the last two terms we have seen an increase in the number of IEP achieved targets for physical and independence rise from 67% to 82%. </p><p>
							Overall, this money has been used to provide additional staff support for PE, hydrotherapy and KS2 swimming to help reduce the physical barriers our pupils have to overcome to access any physical activities (80% of budget). This additional support has enabled pupils to take part in a higher level of physical activity.  </p><p> 
							2019/20 we will receive approximately £16,000.

								<h2>Key Stage 2 Results</h2>
							</header>
							<p>All the pupils at Saxon Wood access the National Curriculum.  This is differentiated to meet their physical and learning needs.</p>
							<p>All of our KS1 pupils and the overwhelming majority of our KS2 pupils are working on the P Levels.  These are levels leading to National Curriculum Level 1.</p>
							<p>All of our pupils are working below mainstream expectations because of their special needs.</p>
							<p>Where pupils fall below expectations we provide additional support.  However for some pupils such as those who are nonverbal there are significant communication barriers for them to overcome.   Medical and physical needs can also limit how pupils access the curriculum. We strive to break down these barriers because of the impact they have on pupils learning and quality of life.</p>
							<p><b>National Performance Tables</b></p>
							<p>Saxon Wood pupils are working below the level thresholds with regards to National Curriculum statutory reporting.  Children at the school rarely sit SATs because of the level they are working at.  We do not therefore return data for the National Performance Tables on an annual basis.</p>
							<p><b>KS2 Achievement July 2018 all pupils (16)</b></p>
							<p><b>94% of children made expected or above progress in English</b></p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">

							<p>Maths: 79% of children achieved their IEP targets</p>
							<p>Communication: 81% of children achieved their IEP targets</p>
							<p>General average across 5 IEP areas in KS2 was 80% (Communication, literacy, maths, PSD, physical).</p>
