								<h2>Statement about needs</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The range of physical disability catered for is very wide, as is the range of learning difficulty.  The majority of pupils have one or more additional disabilities associated with their physical conditions.  These include:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>learning difficulties mild to severe</li>
								<li>hearing impairment</li>
								<li>visual impairment</li>
								<li>perceptual problems</li>
								<li>communication difficulties due to limitations of speech musculature</li>
								<li>complex medical condition</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Pupils at Saxon Wood follow either the Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum or the National Curriculum, differentiated to meet individual needs.  We aim to remove barriers to learning by, for example, the provision of specialised equipment, therapy support and classroom support where required.</p>

								<h2>Early Years Foundation Stage</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The early years at Saxon Wood includes children in both Willow Class (Nursery) and Oak Class (Year R). This Policy covers the curriculum for pupils two years old until the end of Year R and incorporates the curriculum guidance for the foundation stage.</p>
							<p>The curriculum is divided into 7 areas of learning and development. Children should mostly develop the 3 prime areas first. These are:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>Communication and language</li>
								<li>Physical development</li>
								<li>Personal, social and emotional development</li>
							</ul>
							<p>As children grow, the prime areas will help them to develop skills in 4 specific areas. These are:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>Literacy</li>
								<li>Mathematics</li>
								<li>Understanding the world</li>
								<li>Expressive arts and design</li>
							</ul>
							<p>These 7 areas are used to plan your child’s learning and activities.  Staff will make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs.  This is a bit like a curriculum in primary and secondary schools, but it is suitable for very young children. It is designed to be really flexible so that staff can follow your child’s unique needs and interests.  Children in the EYFS learn by playing and exploring, being active, and through creative and critical thinking which takes place both indoors and outside.</p>

								<h2>Multidisciplinary</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Staff have examined a range of approaches and studied relevant research, and our practice is under continual review.  We believe that we are using the most effective and appropriate methods for our pupils.  Saxon Wood aims to be a school with a therapeutic environment.  In practice this means that during a pupil's day, he or she may be undertaking a therapeutic programme whilst simultaneously working at curricular activities such as literacy or mathematics.  Wherever possible they are undertaking therapeutic activities in a functional and meaningful way.</p>
							<p>All pupils for whom it is appropriate will have a Physical Management Programme.  This is an outline of how each pupil's needs are going to be met, through postural management, mobility activities and independence skills practice.  All staff are trained how to facilitate pupils' movements, and are aware of the current physical and functional independence goals for each of their pupils.  These goals are discussed and reviewed termly at interdisciplinary class discussion.  We believe that this combined approach is most likely to enable each pupil to achieve his or her potential in terms of independent function.</p>

						<section id="communicationskills">
							<header>
								<h2>Development of Communication Skills</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The school has developed particular expertise with respect to teaching communication skills to non-vocal pupils.  These pupils will be using Alternative or Augmented Communication Aids, including signs, symbol systems and voice output devices.  Staff aim to ensure that all pupils have as many opportunities for real communication as possible.</p>
						</section>
						<section id="reading">
							<header>
								<h2>Reading at Saxon Wood</h2>
							</header>
							<p>At Saxon Wood we use a combination of mainstream and SEN approaches to meet the needs of our children.  We recognise that reading for the pupils at Saxon Wood encompasses more than an ability to read the written text.  
							Many of our children are at a pre reading stage of development and a large majority are either non verbal or have limited speech.
							To meet these needs we use a wide range of strategies in addition to exposure to reading across the curriculum.  These include symbol timetables, symbol based communication devices, objects of reference, tactile timetables, and PECS.  For pre reading children, children with severe visual or hearing impairments we use a range of sensory materials.   All of these strategies are used to enable children to decode and understand the world around them.</p>
							<p>In addition:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>We use the Oxford Reading Tree scheme and have a large selection of fiction, nonfiction and poetry to match each of the stages.</li>
								<li>Enlarged Oxford reading Tree books are available for children with visual impairment.</li>
								<li>In school we access The Oxford Owl website which has a selection of online audio books and activities. Children are encouraged to use this at home</li>
								<li>We use Espresso and Education City both of which support literacy skills. Children can access these at home with their own login.</li>
								<li>Taped stories and CDs are available for children with visual impairments to listen to stories independently.</li>
								<li>The Hampshire Library Service provides us with additional books and materials on a termly basis to support our areas of study and to meet pupils' interests.</li>
								<li>Phonics is taught across the school using a combination of Jolly Phonics and Letters and Sounds.</li>
								<li>ICT such as ipads or tablets are used to encourage reading as well as ICT skills.</li>
								<li>Displays and worksheets and class based resources are often produced using symbols to increase children’s access to written material.</li>
								<li>Each year we celebrate Book Week and children have an opportunity to get involved in all sorts of fun activities related to reading.</li>
								<li>Our school library area is updated on a regular basis</li>
							</ul>
							<p>IEP targets along with reading records are used to measure progress and identify areas in need of improvement/development.
							The Speech and Language therapy and communication programmes also reinforce language acquisition and functional reading.</p>

								<h2>Physical Management Programmes</h2>
							</header>
							<p>An integrated therapy/physical management programme for each pupil is offered as part of their Individual Education Plan.  Education staff and Health Authority staff work very closely with each other and with parents, to ensure that pupils' needs are met in a planned and co-ordinated way.  The school has developed a transdisciplinary approach to meeting pupils' movement and therapy needs.  Members of the interdisciplinary team based at Saxon Wood share their expertise and knowledge stimulating professional development across traditional professional boundaries.</p>

							<p>This is what the School Council Representatives said about being on the Saxon Wood School Council</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>It is good being on the School Council</li>
								<li>We discuss things like Red Nose Day</li>
								<li>We chat about things that we can do at school</li>
								<li>We make decisions like Red Nose Day</li>

								<h2>Pupil Premium</h2>
							</header>
							<p>From September 2012, schools have a statutory obligation to publish details of their Pupil Premium allocation, use and impact.
							In the financial years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 the school received £976 and £5607, of Pupil Premium Funding, respectively.
							As of September 2013, 9 pupils are eligible to receive free school meals (FSM). There are no looked after children at present and this figure includes children from service families.  The school will receive Pupil Premium Funding of £10,700  in the financial year 2013-2014.
							The Pupil Premium Funding supports the achievement of children who are within the above categories.
							Schools, head teachers and teachers will decide how to use the Pupil Premium allocation, as they are best placed to assess what additional provision should be made for individual pupils. Source DfE website.
							Further, OFSTED will 'pay particular attention to how schools are using the pupil premium to improve pupils' achievement'.
							Listed below is a detailed breakdown of how the school has used the funding for those who are eligible to receive the Pupil Premium for FSM for 2013-2014.
							</p> 
							<p>
							<table cellpadding="10">

							</p>
							<p><strong>Progress of children receiving Pupil Premium Funding 2012-2013</strong></p>
							<p>
							50% of the children on the Pupil Premium made good progress with 50% making outstanding progress in English.
							For Mathematics, 30% of the children made good progress with 70% making outstanding progress.
							Overall the pupils at Saxon Wood School on the Pupil Premium make at least comparable progress to their peers or in many cases better.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Progress of children receiving Pupil Premium Funding 2014/2015</strong></p>
							<p>
							In 2014/2015 we received £14,871 for pupil premium.
							Pupils are on track to at least meet end of KS2 expectations with 57% being on the median for English and 43% predicted to be in the Upper quartile.  For Maths 29% are on track to be in the median and 71% on track for the Upper Quartile by the end of KS2.  Targeted work will continue for these children to ensure they get at least these predicted levels and where possible move into the Upper Quartile.
							EYFS pupils are making good progress on their IEP targets and progress so far indicates that they are making comparable progress to their peers or better.

								<h2>Sports Funding</h2>
							</header>
							<p>2013/2014 we received £8120
							This funding was used to provide additional therapy support, support for hydro therapy and swimming.  We also employed a sports coach for one morning a week and for our after school sports club, one evening a week.
							</p><p>2014/2015 we have received to date £4740.  This has been used to provide additional therapy support, support for hydro therapy and swimming. 
							This money has been used to provide additional staff support for PE, hydrotherapy and KS2 swimming to help reduce the physical barriers our pupils have to overcome to access any physical activities.  This additional support has enabled pupils taking part in these activities to have an enriched experience.  
							Due to the high physical needs of our pupils additional support for therapy sessions has also been facilitated through sports funding.

								<h2>Key Stage 2 Results</h2>
							</header>
							<p>All the pupils at Saxon Wood access the National Curriculum.  This is differentiated to meet their physical and learning needs.</p>
							<p>All of our KS1 pupils and the overwhelming majority of our KS2 pupils are working on the P Levels.  These are levels leading to National Curriculum Level 1.</p>
							<p>All of our pupils are working below mainstream expectations because of their special needs.</p>
							<p>The KS2 results for the last three years are difficult to put into a national context.  This is because we are a very small specialist special school and the size of our cohorts is small. Our pupils’ needs are also very varied.  Over the last three years 10 pupils have left at the end of KS2:  6 pupils  in 2012, and 2 pupils in 2013 and 2014 respectively.</p>
							<p>We judge the school with regards to pupils' progress and attainment as good with a proportion of KS2 leavers making outstanding progress i.e. 30% of learners in English and 40% in maths being in the upper quartile.  NB  (Quartiles based on National Progression Guidance- a government data set for pupils with special needs.  Cohort comprises of 10 pupils leaving over a three year period).</p>
							<p>Where pupils fall below expectations we provide additional support.  However for some pupils such as those who are nonverbal there are significant communication barriers for them to overcome.   Medical and physical needs can also limit how pupils access the curriculum. We strive to break down these barriers because of the impact they have on pupils learning and quality of life.</p>
							<p><b>National Performance Tables</b></p>
							<p>Saxon Wood pupils are working below the level thresholds with regards to National Curriculum statutory reporting.  Children at the school rarely sit SATs because of the level they are working at.  We do not therefore return data for the National Performance Tables on an annual basis.</p>
